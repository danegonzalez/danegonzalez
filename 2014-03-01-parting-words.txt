When I began [this magazine](https://danegonzalez.com/unspecified-mag/), my interest in design had just begun. Prior to my fascination with design, I had always loved to create things, yet I felt my mind was too rationally-oriented to just be a regular artist. Art felt too subjective for me to consider it as a career interest. I needed an outlet for channeling this objective part of my mind, so I had ruled out art as a possible career for that reason. So prior to learning about web design and graphic design, I had thought I was going to go to school to become a chemical engineer. After all, I have been relatively good at math and science in primary school and in my future job I would be creating and making things for practical purposes. Although I was pretty good at math and science, I never really had a passion for it outside of school; the chemical engineering thing just seemed like the right fit for the type of person I was.

After joining a web design class my senior year, I got this passion for web design in a way I never really had for any other thing that involved actual work. Even though I had a similar course in middle school, my high school class allowed a lot more creative freedom. I enjoyed it so much I joined the school’s SkillsUSA club as well as other extracurricular contests. By the end of my senior year I had won about $100 in prize money, SkillsUSA regionals gold medal, and SkillsUSA state championships silver medal, all from web design. If that wasn’t enough I also had a paid opportunity to build a website for a client right after I graduated. However, I quickly learned from my experiences in high school and the client work, that I had a good understanding of web programming, but it was actually my passion for creating a beautifully designed website that was fueling the creation of these sites. So, I hibernated the web programming side of things and focused on design, and that’s when my passion for graphic design began.I was captivated by the idea of being able to solve problems through visual design. I believe it captured my interests and skill set perfectly. I was interested by the whole general idea, but didn’t quite know where to start. So I began Unspecified Magazine because I knew a magazine has many of the fundamental aspects of design: logo design, layout, illustration, typography, designing for print, etc. This last year working on this magazine has taught me so much, as well as that it’s really difficult to try to do it all, and consequently learning the true importance of improving through specialization. More importantly, it has now sparked my interest in lettering as I enter design school. I now have a basic understanding of design, the design tools, and I even have an area of interest. What’s left for me now is betterment through learning and practice. So I believe this magazine has leaded me to where I wanted to go, and I believe it has also brought a positive light to many deserving people and causes, and I feel its right to have it come to an end.

However, that’s not what this is all about. All of this happened in about 3 years’ time and there is no way I could have predicted three years ago that my interests would change from chemical engineering to lettering...I mean, who does that? Once I began pursuing web design, I noticed that the things we conceive in our minds to be right, hardly ever are the same in the future. I had this preconceived notion that being a chemical engineer would get me the fulfillment out of life that I wanted, and I held on close to that idea. I believe that there are many other people along with myself that like to feel like they know where they’re headed in life and won’t let anything change that. However, I felt that my passion for design was much stronger than the idea of chemical engineering I had for myself. So, I let go of it. I knew that if something like web design could make me disregard the strong idea I had about being a chemical engineer, something could take me away from the idea of web design. Strangely, that was freeing for me, and that’s how this magazine came about. By the time I started this magazine, I began understanding that your life and your interests aren’t supposed to be planned. They’re perpetually changing, and the difference in where those changes lead you is within the act of actively participating in that change.

I knew change was not only inevitable, but necessary and the start of this magazine was for that same reason. I just wanted to jump straight into graphic design and see where I would land. At this point in time I believe that I have landed, and that “where,” is at lettering. I could have never known I would be into lettering after web design, but I allowed myself to take that journey. The end of this project is just the beginning for me in my design pursuits – it’s part of the change I needed to have in order to realize what’s next. So I am glad to have this project end, because it allows me to focus my energy on my next journey. I don’t know where I will be in the next few years with design either, and that’s not the important part. Things will change and the most important part is to embrace it. As a part of our human nature, we like feel we have control over our surroundings, but truth is, everything is changing. Life is full of seasons, ever-changing and different from the last. So you must go out and embrace that change.

So, I want to thank everyone that showed appreciation for my beginning endeavors into the field of graphic design through this magazine.
