The following is the archive of my independently published magazine, Unspecified Mag, in reverse chronological order. This was a year long project devoted to providing exposure to local artists, individuals, and groups. Unspecified Mag was a seasonal magazine and it began in January 2013 and was hibernated in March 2014. Read my Parting Words article to learn why I moved on from the magazine.
