These are my lettering pieces from March 2014, **the 1st month and the beginning of my Project 365.** This is a project to create a new lettering piece every day for a year. This project was originally shared on my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/heyimdane) account – Watch the [Project 365 Recap Video](http://danegonzalez.com/365) and discover the "36.5 Things I've Learned from Creating Everyday for 365 Days" [Blog Post](http://danegonzalez.com/365)

<a href="http://danegonzalez.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/0-1024x762.jpg"></a>

With the end of my magazine, I have been vaguely mentioning moving on to bigger and better things and projects, but actually I have been ready to move on to one specific project I have been thinking about for a really long time now and am finally ready to share it with all of you.

I will be beginning the project of creating something everyday for 365 days. I have the insatiable desire to get better everyday and believe this project will hold me accountable to this goal of mine. I want to create something of worth each day, and it may not be a different message each day, but it will be a different medium. This is because part of this project is me showing my design process. I want to show how I work. So, for example, I may show a drawing one day, a vector image of that drawing the next day, and the end result apply that vector to a video. I will begin this starting tomorrow and the hashtag will be #dg365 and as much as this project is for me, I hope I can inspire you guys through my work. So, hope you guys enjoy!

I think ima do something like KineticTypographyTuesdays or something like that lol but I won't name it that cause it's too awkward lol. Anyway, I thought this song was appropriate on beginning this project. HAIM - Falling. (1/365)

Not sure if my favorite part of yesterday was actually skating or skating home. Took a few quick pictures on my phone of the amazing sunset and ended up with this happy accident, with some bokeh action going on. (4/365)

Trying new things with this zoom out time-lapse, but it's a little choppy because I didn't know what I was doing lol. Lana Del Rey - American (5/365)

Here's some kinetic type of "Best Friend" by Foster. Really been liking this song lately.

But on a side note, after a week of this project I've been thinking about refocusing my content. My intent has been to create things that include everything I'm interested in. Although, it's really hard for me to not do things like kinetic typography or time-lapse photography I'm thinking that I am just doing to have to. I think my problem is I try to do too many things. Not like that's a problem, but I want to really focus my efforts and actually make progress at my hand-lettering skills. So for now, I'm going to try and cut back on the extra things and maybe revisit them once I can do them justice. (8/365)

After yesterday's piece, I wanted to be able to provide something to the people that really enjoyed my work. So I spent my day converting my last piece into vector and adding texture to it, to be able to provide this <a href="http://danegonzalez.com/free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FREE wallpaper</a> for you guys. This black version as well as a white version is available on my website, go to the link in my bio to get this inspirational quote on your phone. They are optimized for iPhone 5/5s, however they should be able to work just as well on other devices. Enjoy! (10/365)

Do you feel that the world is so vast that you feel sort of lost in all that it has to offer?

I share my incites on this idea in a blog post and explain while limiting yourself can actually set you free. <a title="Limitations are the Keys to Freedom" href="http://danegonzalez.com/limitations/">The link is in my bio</a>. (11/365)

Wasn't really looking to practice #calligraphy yet, even after yesterday. Neither, was I ready to implement them on a piece either (i.e. smudges, ink splatter), however, I thought that these lyrics needed it. (20/365)
