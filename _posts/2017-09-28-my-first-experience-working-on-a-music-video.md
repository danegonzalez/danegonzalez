A few weeks ago, I worked on my first music video. I was a part of a team of animators to help put together a full-length music video.

The Canadian band, Tennyson, asked several of their fans on Instagram and Twitter for help on their upcoming animation project.

So, I drew a few seconds of animation that was put together into the following music video:

A couple weeks after the video was released, they came to play a show in Sacramento, and I was able to stop by and see them perform. Their show was great, and they were cool enough to hang out and talk with anyone afterwords. So, I talked to them a bit, talked about the music video, and also got a picture with them.

It's pretty cool that I can now say I've worked on a music video, and that the first one was for one of my favorite bands.&nbsp;It was fun all around, from the animation to the show, and it has inspired me to focus more on music videos.

I thank them for allowing me to be a small part in their music video and inspiring me to do more in my own work.
